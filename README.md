The R Script "run_analysis.R" performs the below steps using the dataset provided as part of the "Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project":

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

From step 5 above a final dataset gets created called: "TidyData.txt

The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the dataset
